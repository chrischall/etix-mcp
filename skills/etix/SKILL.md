description: Search Etix events, venues, and performers and pull event/venue details via MCP. Triggers on phrases like "find events on etix", "etix tickets for", "what's playing at <venue> on etix", "etix event details for", "search etix for <artist>", or any request involving Etix events, venues, performers, or showtimes. Requires etix-mcp installed and the ContextMint Bridge extension active with an open etix.com tab (see Setup below).

# etix-mcp

MCP server for Etix — natural-language search of events, venues, and performers, plus full event and venue detail. Routes through your signed-in etix.com tab via the ContextMint Bridge browser extension, so Etix's DataDome bot-wall sees a real browser session instead of a Node process. No Etix account is required — this is public event-discovery data.

- **npm:** [npmjs.com/package/etix-mcp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/etix-mcp)
- **Source:** [github.com/chrischall/etix-mcp](https://github.com/chrischall/etix-mcp)

> ⚠️ Etix does not publish a public consumer API, and its consumer site sits behind a DataDome interstitial. This server reads the same `/ticket/api/online/...` endpoints and server-rendered pages that etix.com itself uses, dispatched through your own signed-in browser tab via the ContextMint Bridge extension. Use at your own discretion.

## Setup

### 1. Install etix-mcp

`.mcp.json` (project) or `~/.claude/mcp.json` (global):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "etix": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "etix-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Install ContextMint Bridge (one-time, shared across all fetchproxy-based MCPs)

Download it from [ContextMint Bridge releases](https://github.com/nullnet-app/contextmint-bridge/releases):

- **Chrome:** unzip the Chrome zip, then load it at `chrome://extensions` (Developer mode → Load unpacked → the unzipped folder).
- **Safari:** ships inside the ContextMint app, which has no public download link yet — use Chrome for now.

ContextMint Bridge is the fetchproxy extension under its new name, from the same maintainer ([fetchproxy's README](https://github.com/chrischall/fetchproxy#extension) points to it). Its source is public at [nullnet-app/contextmint-bridge](https://github.com/nullnet-app/contextmint-bridge): build it yourself, or verify a release zip with `shasum -a 256 -c contextmint-bridge-chrome-<version>.zip.sha256` (the `.sha256` file is published beside it).

All fetchproxy MCPs share one extension and one port (`37149`).

### 3. Open etix.com and approve the pairing

Open [etix.com](https://www.etix.com/ticket/) in your browser and let it finish loading (so the DataDome check clears). The first tool call prints a one-time pairing code — approve it in the ContextMint Bridge popup. After that, run `etix_healthcheck` to confirm the bridge is green end-to-end.

## Tools

| Tool | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `etix_search` | Search events, venues, and performers by keyword. Each result carries its id + canonical etix.com URL. |
| `etix_get_event` | Full detail for an event/performance by `event_id` — name, date/time, venue (address + coordinates), organizer, price range and individual priced offer levels. |
| `etix_get_venue` | A venue by `venue_id` — name, organizer, address, and its list of upcoming events. |
| `etix_find_location` | Resolve a city or postal code to coordinates (building block for location-based browsing). |
| `etix_healthcheck` | End-to-end bridge check — round-trips `/robots.txt` and reports which hop failed (bridge down vs. extension not connected vs. DataDome challenge on your tab). Call when other tools fail. |

## Acknowledgement of Terms

By using this MCP server, you acknowledge and agree to the following:

**1. This server uses your own etix.com session.** Every request is dispatched through your own browser tab via the ContextMint Bridge extension — your cookies, your TLS, your session.

**2. No public API.** Etix does not offer a public consumer API; this reads the website's own endpoints and pages. Etix may change them at any time.

**3. Use at your own discretion**, consistent with Etix's Terms of Use. This is an unofficial, AI-developed project with no affiliation to Etix.
