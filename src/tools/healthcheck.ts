/**
 * Round-trip a small public etix.com URL (`/robots.txt`) through the full
 * bridge so the user can tell — with ONE tool call — which hop is broken:
 * the WebSocket bridge, the fetchproxy extension, or Etix itself (a DataDome
 * challenge on the signed-in tab).
 *
 * The probe loop, error classification, bridge projection, result shape, and
 * hint ladder all live in `registerBridgeHealthcheckTool`
 * (`@chrischall/mcp-utils/fetchproxy`). Only the etix-specific bits are wired
 * here:
 *
 *  - `probeFn` routes through `client.fetchHtml`, so the probe exercises the
 *    same bot-wall guard real tools do — a DataDome interstitial on
 *    `/robots.txt` surfaces as a `BotWallError`.
 *  - `classifyThrown` maps that `BotWallError` to a `bot_wall` kind with
 *    DataDome-clear copy (the one error condition etix cares about that the
 *    generic ladder can't name), and lifts the wall's structured `vendor` +
 *    `retryAfterSeconds` into `error.detail` via 0.12's detail hook.
 *  - `hints.ok` keeps etix's DataDome-flavored "healthy bridge" copy.
